    # If this is "false" (the default), the cluster administrator is
    # responsible for creating ClusterDomainClaims and delegating them to
    # namespaces via their spec.Namespace field. This setting should be used in
    # multitenant environments which need to control which namespace can use a
    # particular domain name in a domain mapping.

    # If this is "true", users are able to associate arbitrary names with their
    # services via the DomainMapping feature.

    # If true, networking plugins can add additional information to deployed
    # applications to make their pods directly accessible via their IPs even if mesh is
    # enabled and thus direct-addressability is usually not possible.
    # Consumers like Knative Serving can use this setting to adjust their behavior
    # accordingly, i.e. to drop fallback solutions for non-pod-addressable systems.

    # Cluster IP (less efficient, needed when mesh is enabled unless
    # `enable-mesh-pod-addressability`, above, is set).
    # Permitted values are:
    #  - "auto" (default): automatically determine which mesh mode to use by trying Pod IP and falling back to Cluster IP as needed.
    #  - "enabled": always use Cluster IP and do not attempt to use Pod IPs.
    #  - "disabled": always use Pod IPs and do not fall back to Cluster IP on failure.
